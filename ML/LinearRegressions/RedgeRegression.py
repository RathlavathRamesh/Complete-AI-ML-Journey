# Ridge Regression
# What is Ridge Regression?
# Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty (regularization) to the loss function to prevent overfitting.
# It is also called L2 Regularization.

# Why Do We Need Ridge Regression?
# Overfitting: In ordinary linear regression, the model can fit the training data too closely, especially when there are many features or when features are highly correlated. This leads to poor performance on new data.
# Stability: Ridge regression helps stabilize the model by shrinking the coefficients, making the model less sensitive to noise.
# How Does Ridge Regression Work?
# Ridge regression modifies the cost function by adding a penalty term:

# Cost Function
# J(β) = (1/n) * Σ [yᵢ - ŷᵢ]² + λ * Σ βⱼ²
# Where:

# J(β) is the cost function.
# yᵢ is the actual value.
# ŷᵢ is the predicted value.
# βⱼ are the model coefficients.
# λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter (controls the strength of the penalty).
# The first term is the usual mean squared error.
# The second term penalizes large coefficients.
# Parameters
# Coefficients (βⱼ): The weights for each feature.
# Regularization parameter (λ): Controls how much penalty is applied.
# If λ = 0: Ridge regression becomes ordinary linear regression.
# If λ is large: Coefficients are shrunk more, possibly towards zero.
# How Ridge Regression Solves Overfitting
# By penalizing large coefficients, the model is forced to keep them small.
# This reduces model complexity and helps generalize better to new data.
# Summary
# Ridge regression is used when you have many features or multicollinearity.
# It adds a regularization term to the cost function.
# The regularization parameter λ controls the trade-off between fitting the data and keeping the coefficients small.
