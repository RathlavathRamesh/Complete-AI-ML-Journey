Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a curious cat.
The cat loved to explore every corner of the house and garden.
One day, the cat saw a shiny butterfly and chased it happily.
The butterfly flew away, but the cat learned something new.
Curiosity helps us learn, but patience keeps us safe.
